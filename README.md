# ConsoleGPT (Python)

This is one way to implement a ChatGPT-like interface for your shell/console using Python.

## How to use

**Note**: This assumes you already have Python. Check the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you don't have it.

0. If you haven't already, setup your OpenAI API key. See [OpenAI's Quickstart tutorial](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python).

1. Download the [script](chatbot.py) into your preferred location.

2. Open your terminal and navigate to the script's directory (e.g., `cd /path/to/script/directory` in Linux/macOS).
   
3. Input `python chatbot.py` to execute the script.
